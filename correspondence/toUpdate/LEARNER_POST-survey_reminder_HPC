We will be emptying the 'training' user group and clearing out the 'training' project area on Rocket and RDW (/nobackup/proj/training/ and /rdw/03/rse-hpc/training/)
Any files you have saved in your 'home' directory (~ or /mnt/nfs/home/userid) will not be touched but you will only be able to access them if you have login access to Rocket because you are part of another project on Rocket.

Good Afternoon

Many thanks for coming to our workshop on {humandate}.  We enjoyed meeting you and hope that you enjoyed and benefited from the {workshop} workshop.   

As we briefly mentioned in the workshop, your 'training' enrolment on Rocket was only temporary.

We want our workshops to be the best they can be and your input really helps us!

You'll get a separate email from workshops.ncl.ac.uk with another survey, because the PGR development team need to collect different feedback. Sorry about that!
