BODY: 
Good Afternoon

Many thanks for coming to our workshop this Tuesday.  We enjoyed meeting you and hope that you enjoyed and benefited from the [workshop] workshop.   
From the number of responses, most of you have already filled this in, but because it's anonymous we don't know who is missing so this is your friendly reminder to please fill in the post-workshop survey at: 

https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/UgVdRQ?slug=[slug]
  
We want our workshops to be the best they can be and your input really helps us!

You'll get a separate email from workshops.ncl.ac.uk with another survey, because the PGR development team need to collect different feedback. Sorry about that!
