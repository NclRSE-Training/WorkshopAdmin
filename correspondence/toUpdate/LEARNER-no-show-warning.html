subject: [workshop] - [humandate]


Hi

We missed you at yesterday's <workshop> Workshop.

Our workshops are very popular but numbers are limited so there's always a waiting list. We understand that circumstances change and mistakes happen, but you may have taken a place from someone else who wanted to attend. For this reason we may block bookings from people who make a habit of skipping workshops without letting us know.

We would love to welcome you at another workshop if you'd like to book in again, but next time please let us know if you can't attend.

Best wishes,

The RSE Training Team
