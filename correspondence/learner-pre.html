Good Afternoon

Thank you for registering for the <WorkshopTitle> Workshop on <strong><Humandate> (08:45-17:00)</strong> in <strong>Room <Room></strong> in <Building> <i>https://what3words.com/<w3w></i>

The stern bit:  
Please note that there is a waiting list for this workshop so if you can't attend, please log in and unenrol at https://workshops.ncl.ac.uk/view/book/modal/<OccurrenceID>
We want everyone to have a chance to learn with us.  If you reserve a place but don't attend, you are taking that chance away from someone else so we will inform your supervisor if you fail to attend without letting us know.
If you can't un-enrol yourself, please email carol.booth2@ncl.ac.uk and jannetta.steyn@ncl.ac.uk as we may still be able to re-allocate your place.
